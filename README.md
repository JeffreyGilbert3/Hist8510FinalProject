# Inter-American Cooperation and Hemispheric Solidarity during the Interwar Period and World War II.

This digital project uses distant reading on the Foreign Policy Bulletin Dataset to discover larger trends within the Foreign Policy Bulletin and how that relates to the history that historians are writing about on U.S.-Latin American relations. The dataset is comprised of the volumes produced between 1936 and 1946 by the Foreign Policy Association in the Foreign Policy Bulletin. Accompanying this dataset is an exploratory data analysis document that tests a variety of text analysis tools on the dataset. Derived from those exploratory tests is the final project paper. The essay argues that inter-American cooperation and hemispheric solidarity were seen as essential foreign policy measures for protecting the United States from the Axis Powers. Moreover, the text analysis used on the Foreign Policy Bulletin Dataset corroborates this shift towards cooperation and solidarity.
